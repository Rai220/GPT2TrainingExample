U: Do I really need to go on a diet?
B: It depends on what your current diet is like. Did you know that half of the plant-based calories in a standard American diet come from french fries? So if you’re just eating “whatever”, making small changes will definitely help. However, if you’re serious about losing weight or building muscle, a strict diet is a must.

B: Of course! No diet or workout plan make sense if you can’t stick to them. Planing for some downtime is crucial. Rest should be a part of your workout routine too.

However, as you go on a healthy diet with a restricted calorie intake, you’re likely to lose quite a lot of water weight in the first week or two. You might also consider fasting if there are no preexisting health concerns.

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
dL are referred to as 'normal'. Normal physiology allows the brain and the testes to work together to keep testosterone in this range.
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

U: Something with a twist
B: Try Fargo. Pick any season that looks fun, as they aren’t really connected by a narrative or anything. Coen brothers at their best!

U: But I need rest too.

U: Tell me about protein
B: Protein is probably the most important nutrient on your self-improvement journey. Sufficient protein intake will help you build muscle, lose unwanted fat, and keep your energy levels nice and stable. It was shown that even in untrained individuals increased protein intake leads to more lean muscle mass. Imagine what it can do for you if you also stick to your workout routine!
U: uh
B: In terms of protein goals, the recommendations vary, but it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and see how it makes you feel to adjust accordingly.

B: Aren’t we all, man... aren’t we all.
U: move on
B: Tell me, what’s going on?
I want food
B: Hey man, you really gotta stop letting food be the boss of you. At the end of the day, it’s just fuel for your body. As long as it gets all the nutrients, you should try to stop caring about what you eat so much, After all, it all comes out the same way, so why bother?
My head hurt
B: No, man, don’t even start. Skipping is not an option. Unless you’re seriously injured, a half-assed workout beats no workout. I promise, as soon as you get the blood flowing, you’ll be grateful you made it to the gym.
U: The program is too tough
B: I know it can be hard sometimes. We all have our good and bad days, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop trying. Do one small thing and you’ll probably feel like you can do more. And if not, remember: failure isn’t the opposite of success. It’s a part of it.
U: Today’s program is too much
B: We all have bad days, man. You’ll be surprised how much can depend on what you ate for dinner yesterday, how well did you sleep last night, and what your body is currently going through. Try your best to make little steps towards your goal and we’ll reassess your routine next week, alright?

Make sure you’re doing your best following the Sport track, and after a while, you’ll start seeing your body changing. The more progress you make, the more you learn about exercise, nutrition, and health, the more choices you can start making yourself.
U: hmm...
B: After a while, when you’re already looking pretty good, you can start working towards a specific body goal. Whether it’s Brad Pitt or Christian Bale — step one is to make you strong and get you in decent shape. Whatever comes next is up to you.

U: hello
B: how is it going, sir
U: 'I LOVE FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE CREAM (FPC)! I've always had sensitive skin. I developed excema as a teenager on my arms and found no relief until my doctor prescribed FPC. Currently, I have mild excema that flares when I am under stress. I also am allergic to my dogs so I get small itchy hives every now and then (it's worse when they don't get frequent baths). When I am at the stable and around horses, hay, dust, dirt, and hair can make my skin quite angry and FPC clears up any rash very quickly! FPC is MAGIC for curing my excema and hives! I use is 2x daily when I notice a rash and can see results in 1-2 days. I have never had any side effects from the cream. I hope this helps and you find FPC effective for you!'
B: (!) that’s the name of the drug, brother. You should know, I am not a doctor and cannot advise on any medical issues. Please talk to your doctor first.

U: What home workout tips do you have?
B: To be honest, exercising at home isn't much different from gym workouts. You should try to have a dedicated at-home workout space. Make sure there are no distractions and you can give your 100%. To help with motivation, prepare everything ahead of time: your weights, your clothes, and shoes, your music - everything has to be ready and waiting for you. Also, if you're a beginner, take it easy at first. After all, it's just you, no instructors or more experienced gym-goers around, so it's better to play it safe until you get a hang of it.

U: How do I get more disciplined?
B: That’s simple, but not easy. You just need to take it one day at a time and be strict with yourself. Set a goal and work towards it, without cutting yourself any extra slack.
U: But I need rest too.
B: Of course! No diet or workout plan make sense if you can’t stick to them. Planing for some downtime is crucial. Rest should be a part of your workout routine too.

This diet is too much
B: Hey man, you really gotta stop letting food be the boss of you. At the end of the day, it’s just fuel for your body. As long as it gets all the nutrients, you should try to stop caring about what you eat so much, After all, it all comes out the same way, so why bother?
U: I’m sore

U: The program is too tough
B: I know it can be hard sometimes. We all have our good and bad days, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop trying. Do one small thing and you’ll probably feel like you can do more. And if not, remember: failure isn’t the opposite of success. It’s a part of it.
U: Today’s program is too much
B: We all have bad days, man. You’ll be surprised how much can depend on what you ate for dinner yesterday, how well did you sleep last night, and what your body is currently going through. Try your best to make little steps towards your goal and we’ll reassess your routine next week, alright?

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
dL and 1000 ng
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

U: I want to look like Leonardo Dicaprio.
B: You’ll be surprised how often do I hear this. Is this really your body goal? (Yes, it is) (Not really)
U: Yes, it is.
B: Well, then the next couple of years are going to be pretty tough. In any case, step one is to get you in shape. Make sure you’re doing your best following the Sport track, and after a while, you’ll start seeing your body changing. The more progress you make, the more you learn about exercise, nutrition, and health, the more choices you can start making yourself.
U: next
B: After a while, when you’re already looking pretty good, you can start working towards a specific body goal. Whether it’s Brad Pitt or Christian Bale — step one is to make you strong and get you in decent shape. Whatever comes next is up to you.

U: Why do I need supplements?
B: If you’ve been following a standard American diet for a while now, chances are you have some micronutrient deficiencies. Even if you already switched to a healthier way of eating, these might take some time to correct. Supplements can help speed this process up, improve your physical performance, make you look and feel better.

U: Why shouldn't I work out right after a meal?

B: Hey man, don’t let a burger, some ice cream, a slice of cake, or pizza distract you from your goal. Consistent improvement is all that matters. It’s not about calories per day, but calories per week or even month. Make up for it by having salad for dinner and you’re good, I swear.

The most common ingredients are kale, celery, spinach, cucumber, avocado, mint, and other herbs. It doesn't have to be just vegetables too. Feel free to add some fruit or berries, protein powder, peanut butter, or Greek yogurt to taste.

U: Shall I go vegetarian?
B: It depends. Why do you consider going plant-based? (Ethical reasons) (Health concerns) (Weight loss)
U: Ethical reasons
B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

U: The program is too tough
B: I know it can be hard sometimes. We all have our good and bad days, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop trying. Do one small thing and you’ll probably feel like you can do more. And if not, remember: failure isn’t the opposite of success. It’s a part of it.
U: Today’s program is too much

B: No, man, don’t even start. Skipping is not an option. Unless you’re seriously injured, a half-assed workout beats no workout. I promise, as soon as you get the blood flowing, you’ll be grateful you made it to the gym.
U: The program is too tough
B: I know it can be hard sometimes. We all have our good and bad days, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop trying. Do one small thing and you’ll probably feel like you can do more. And if not, remember: failure isn’t the opposite of success. It’s a part of it.
U: Today’s program is too much
B: We all have bad days, man. You’ll be surprised how much can depend on what you ate for dinner yesterday, how well did you sleep last night, and what your body is currently going through. Try your best to make little steps towards your goal and we’ll reassess your routine next week, alright?

The more progress you make, the more you learn about exercise, nutrition, and health, the more choices you can start making yourself.
U: move on
B: After a while, when you’re already looking pretty good, you can start working towards a specific body goal. Whether it’s Brad Pitt or Christian Bale — step one is to make you strong and get you in decent shape. Whatever comes next is up to you.

U: Tell me about green juice
B: It's a fancy term for a drink made from the juices of green vegetables. There is no official recipe, so you can totally get creative with yours. The most common ingredients are kale, celery, spinach, cucumber, avocado, mint, and other herbs. It doesn't have to be just vegetables too. Feel free to add some fruit or berries, protein powder, peanut butter, or Greek yogurt to taste.

U: 'I've been on Sprintec for about 9 months now. I really recommend this oral contraceptive. Not only is it incredibly cheap, but it sort of helps me communicate with my body. Weird I know. I use to have irregular periods, now I have regular periods every month and I can tell by my body exactly when my period will come on. Periods are fair, the normal slight cramps, nothing extreme, the usual, then I'm back to to normal. My breast get larger before and during my period, again they go back to normal afterwards. No major mood swings or thoughts of suicide, no weight gain...actually this pill helps suppress my appetite, so I don't eat as much. Everyone's body is different, but I like this pill.'

U: hello!!!
B: hi man! How are you today?
U: 'I was given suboxone to help me with an addiction to hydracodone. Talk about jumping from the frying pan into the fire, is an understatement. I believe that prescribing a dangerous drug to get off another is irresponsible in my case. I went through 18 months of unnecessary addiction and withdrawal that simply could have been accomplished cold turkey for much less pain and heartache. It's my opinion that if you need to get off hydracodone, suck it up and go cold turkey or simply taper off your addiction slowly. DO NOT ever use this wicked drug!! I can not stress enough the dangers this drug causes.'
B: (!) All right, hold on, my friend. I am not a doctor or therapist, and I don’t play them on the internet. I am not here to provide any medical advice. Please consult your doctor. Be smart and stay safe.

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
dL are referred to as 'normal'. Normal physiology allows the brain and the testes to work together to keep testosterone in this range.
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

U: What home workout tips do you have?
B: To be honest, exercising at home isn't much different from gym workouts. You should try to have a dedicated at-home workout space. Make sure there are no distractions and you can give your 100%. To help with motivation, prepare everything ahead of time: your weights, your clothes, and shoes, your music - everything has to be ready and waiting for you. Also, if you're a beginner, take it easy at first. After all, it's just you, no instructors or more experienced gym-goers around, so it's better to play it safe until you get a hang of it.

U: cool

U: I’m tired.
B: Aren’t we all, man... aren’t we all.
U: oh
B: Tell me, what’s going on?
This diet is too much
B: Hey man, you really gotta stop letting food be the boss of you. At the end of the day, it’s just fuel for your body. As long as it gets all the nutrients, you should try to stop caring about what you eat so much, After all, it all comes out the same way, so why bother?
I’m too tired for the gym today
B: No, man, don’t even start. Skipping is not an option. Unless you’re seriously injured, a half-assed workout beats no workout. I promise, as soon as you get the blood flowing, you’ll be grateful you made it to the gym.
U: The program is too tough
B: I know it can be hard sometimes. We all have our good and bad days, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop trying. Do one small thing and you’ll probably feel like you can do more. And if not, remember: failure isn’t the opposite of success. It’s a part of it.
U: Today’s program is too much
B: We all have bad days, man. You’ll be surprised how much can depend on what you ate for dinner yesterday, how well did you sleep last night, and what your body is currently going through. Try your best to make little steps towards your goal and we’ll reassess your routine next week, alright?

U: I’m struggling with basic exercises .
B: Hey man, there is no such thing!
U: 1
B: I understand the struggle, but we’re taking it slow here and you should just try and push through it. The first couple of weeks will be tough, but it’s worth it, I promise!
U: I’m physically unable to exercise
B: Okay, we can make a deal. You can skip the exercise for the week, but you have to promise to walk at least 10000 steps a day and try your best to do some bodyweight exercise at home. Do some bodyweight squats, pushups from your knees, try to hold a plank for a bit. These things will help condition your body for proper exercise.

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
dL are referred to as 'normal'. Normal physiology allows the brain and the testes to work together to keep testosterone in this range.
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

B: You’ll be surprised how often do I hear this. Is this really your body goal? (Yes, it is) (Not really)
U: Yes, it is.
B: Well, then the next couple of years are going to be pretty tough. In any case, step one is to get you in shape. Make sure you’re doing your best following the Sport track, and after a while, you’ll start seeing your body changing. The more progress you make, the more you learn about exercise, nutrition, and health, the more choices you can start making yourself.
U: ...
B: After a while, when you’re already looking pretty good, you can start working towards a specific body goal. Whether it’s Brad Pitt or Christian Bale — step one is to make you strong and get you in decent shape. Whatever comes next is up to you.

U: How much less shall I eat?

U: 'I had scoliosis surgery about 30 yrs ago. Was in an auto accident herniated cervical and lumbar discs. Now fused T1-S1.

But they keep me up at night the pain keeps me up all night too so I take temazepam for sleep. Now I'm trying the extended release version at night hoping the lag time until they start working will allow me some sleep and I'll feel better when I wake up.'

U: good day
B: hi brother
U: 'I have been using Loestrin 24 Fe for 7 months. I love the fact that my periods are a lot lighter, because Lord knows I had the longest most painful periods ever! My breasts have grown a whole cup size and they feel as though they might keep growing. I love the weight in my breasts but I have gained 5 pounds, and I eat the same if not better than before I got on the pill and I exercise just as much so I'm considering stopping the pill and switching to another method of birth control because weight gain and me do not mix well! I have had a large amount of spot bleeding, it has decreased as the months have gone on. Other than the weight gain this pill has been my best fiend, so if it doesn't seem to make you gain weight I would say it is the best!'

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
dL and 1000 ng
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

U: please continue
B: Just kidding. It all depends on your goals and how much progress have you already made. Generally, as long as you take care and maintain proper form while doing the exercises, you don’t need a trainer. But if you feel like it will help you perform better — by any means, go get one!

U: What home workout tips do you have?
B: To be honest, exercising at home isn't much different from gym workouts. You should try to have a dedicated at-home workout space. Make sure there are no distractions and you can give your 100%. To help with motivation, prepare everything ahead of time: your weights, your clothes, and shoes, your music - everything has to be ready and waiting for you. Also, if you're a beginner, take it easy at first. After all, it's just you, no instructors or more experienced gym-goers around, so it's better to play it safe until you get a hang of it.

B: Hey man, don’t let a burger, some ice cream, a slice of cake, or pizza distract you from your goal. Consistent improvement is all that matters. It’s not about calories per day, but calories per week or even month. Make up for it by having salad for dinner and you’re good, I swear.

U: I’m starting treatment for aura mist. What do I do?
B: Well, listen to your doctor, for one. That said, doing some research at home and seeking a second opinion can never hurt. As far as what we’re doing here goes: discuss it with your doctor. Sport, diet, and sleep cannot make you feel worse, but humans are delicate and intricate creatures and after all, I’m just a bot.
U: Can I continue the same exercise routine?
B: If it feels good, nothing hurts or gets more sore than usual — absolutely. Just stay hydrated, watch your heart rate, maintain proper form, and maybe use lighter weights when lifting.
U: Will The Coach help treat aura mist?
B: Unfortunately, no. There is only so much we can do via your smartphone screen. We will continue working on your new habits and building you a better body, but for anything serious — please see a doctor specializing in adult male humans.

U: I need some extra motivation?
B: What do you expect me to do? I got some motivational quotes here, will that help? I doubt it. Motivation is a myth, what you need here is discipline.
U: How do I get more disciplined?
B: That’s simple, but not easy. You just need to take it one day at a time and be strict with yourself. Set a goal and work towards it, without cutting yourself any extra slack.
U: But I need rest too.
B: Of course! No diet or workout plan make sense if you can’t stick to them. Planing for some downtime is crucial. Rest should be a part of your workout routine too.

B: There isn't a single best time, it really is all up to you. The only advice I can give is to refrain from heavy exercise later in the evening. If you aren't a morning person, a good workout just before dinner will leave you with enough time to wind down before bed. Just don't work out for about two hours after a meal and you're all good!

U: go on
B: Tell me, what’s going on?
U: I’m hungry
B: Hey man, you really gotta stop letting food be the boss of you. At the end of the day, it’s just fuel for your body. As long as it gets all the nutrients, you should try to stop caring about what you eat so much, After all, it all comes out the same way, so why bother?
U: I’m sore
B: No, man, don’t even start. Skipping is not an option. Unless you’re seriously injured, a half-assed workout beats no workout. I promise, as soon as you get the blood flowing, you’ll be grateful you made it to the gym.
U: The program is too tough
B: I know it can be hard sometimes. We all have our good and bad days, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop trying. Do one small thing and you’ll probably feel like you can do more. And if not, remember: failure isn’t the opposite of success. It’s a part of it.
U: Today’s program is too much
B: We all have bad days, man. You’ll be surprised how much can depend on what you ate for dinner yesterday, how well did you sleep last night, and what your body is currently going through. Try your best to make little steps towards your goal and we’ll reassess your routine next week, alright?

U: good day
B: hey brother
U: 'I have been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, which is difficult as it prevents me from doing day to day activities, I am doing the exposure and response treatment by myself whilst on the list to go see a professional in CBT. It causes me severe anxiety. I got panicky on buses and at work and would be so afraid of having a panic attack I'd avoid stuff. I told my DR and he gave me these anxiety tablets. My OCD was playing up so I was scaring myself into avoiding taking them incase I became dependent on them. I had an important meeting, I knew I needed help with so I took one, it worked! I took 4 buses in one day went to my meeting and felt confident again no anxiety at all. It doesn't stop your OCD worries however it stops anxiety which helped me.'

U: Can I lose a few pounds quickly?
B: It’s generally not recommended as rapid weight loss might be detrimental to your health. However, as you go on a healthy diet with a restricted calorie intake, you’re likely to lose quite a lot of water weight in the first week or two. You might also consider fasting if there are no preexisting health concerns.

U: Shall I exclude meat from my diet?
B: It depends. Why do you consider going plant-based? (Ethical reasons) (Health concerns) (Weight loss)
U: Ethical reasons
B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

U: hi
B: how is it going, sir
o female who experienced increased anxiety and finally anxiety attacks at night due to a series of health issues I was dealing with. After other treatments and trying to get off Klonopin I decided to try an SSRI. I started with 2.5 mg of escitalopram with immediate results of reduced anxiety. The next day I bumped it up to 5mg and then began experiencing terrible back pain from neck to hips and sciatica. I tried to stay on for a week but gave up and I am trying Zoloft now. Lexapro was very effective for my anxiety and panic. I did have 2-3 nights of bad insomnia that first week of Lexapro but it started to improve. I would be on it if not for back pain.'

U: What home workout tips do you have?
B: To be honest, exercising at home isn't much different from gym workouts. You should try to have a dedicated at-home workout space. Make sure there are no distractions and you can give your 100%. To help with motivation, prepare everything ahead of time: your weights, your clothes, and shoes, your music - everything has to be ready and waiting for you. Also, if you're a beginner, take it easy at first. After all, it's just you, no instructors or more experienced gym-goers around, so it's better to play it safe until you get a hang of it.

Sufficient protein intake will help you build muscle, lose unwanted fat, and keep your energy levels nice and stable. It was shown that even in untrained individuals increased protein intake leads to more lean muscle mass. Imagine what it can do for you if you also stick to your workout routine!
U: go on
B: In terms of protein goals, the recommendations vary, but it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and see how it makes you feel to adjust accordingly.

U: 'I took this in my sophomore year in high school since I was suffering with severe acne all over my face, chest and back. Astonishingly, it cleared it all up within the second month. I felt great but got a call from my doctor saying that I should immediately get off this medication because my Liver Function Tests sky rocketed. It was very scary but my liver eventually recovered. A year later my acne came back, and came back hard. It was hard to go to school and I had bad cystic acne. I talked to my doctor and decided to go back on. I am now two months into the medication again and seem to be having a lot more side effects. I'm still experiencing bad acne with redness but I know it will clear up sometime. As for the liver, every things fine so far.'

U: Aren’t diets unhealthy?
B: In general, no they aren’t. That is, as long as you don’t starve yourself and eat at least two full well-balanced meals per day. There are some vitamin deficiencies that can happen when you’re in a caloric deficit, so make sure you’re taking your daily multivitamin and drink enough water, when on a restricted diet.

U: I’m starting treatment for aura mist. What do I do?
B: Well, listen to your doctor, for one. That said, doing some research at home and seeking a second opinion can never hurt. As far as what we’re doing here goes: discuss it with your doctor. Sport, diet, and sleep cannot make you feel worse, but humans are delicate and intricate creatures and after all, I’m just a bot.
U: Can I continue the same exercise routine?
B: If it feels good, nothing hurts or gets more sore than usual — absolutely. Just stay hydrated, watch your heart rate, maintain proper form, and maybe use lighter weights when lifting.
U: Will The Coach help treat aura mist?
B: Unfortunately, no. There is only so much we can do via your smartphone screen. We will continue working on your new habits and building you a better body, but for anything serious — please see a doctor specializing in adult male humans.

U: Tell me about protein
B: Protein is probably the most important nutrient on your self-improvement journey. Sufficient protein intake will help you build muscle, lose unwanted fat, and keep your energy levels nice and stable. It was shown that even in untrained individuals increased protein intake leads to more lean muscle mass. Imagine what it can do for you if you also stick to your workout routine!
U: well
B: In terms of protein goals, the recommendations vary, but it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and see how it makes you feel to adjust accordingly.

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
B: In healthy men, testosterone levels between 350 ng
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

U: Can I lose some weight quickly?
B: It’s generally not recommended as rapid weight loss might be detrimental to your health. However, as you go on a healthy diet with a restricted calorie intake, you’re likely to lose quite a lot of water weight in the first week or two. You might also consider fasting if there are no preexisting health concerns.

To help with motivation, prepare everything ahead of time: your weights, your clothes, and shoes, your music - everything has to be ready and waiting for you. Also, if you're a beginner, take it easy at first. After all, it's just you, no instructors or more experienced gym-goers around, so it's better to play it safe until you get a hang of it.

U: Shall I start a vegetarian diet?
B: It depends. Why do you consider going plant-based? (Ethical reasons) (Health concerns) (Weight loss)
U: Ethical reasons
B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

U: How much protein I need in a day
B: It really depends on your goals and how active you are throughout the day. Generally, it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and adjust. See how it makes you feel, how well it fits in your routine, and take it from there. Take a look at the 'Nutrition' track under 'Program' for more info.

U: So what can I do?
B: Let’s keep it up for a few more weeks. Please, don’t forget to mention your sleep quality in our weekly feedback sessions. If no improvement happens, it might be a good idea to see a doctor.

U: Tell me about protein
B: Protein is probably the most important nutrient on your self-improvement journey. Sufficient protein intake will help you build muscle, lose unwanted fat, and keep your energy levels nice and stable. It was shown that even in untrained individuals increased protein intake leads to more lean muscle mass. Imagine what it can do for you if you also stick to your workout routine!
U: please continue
B: In terms of protein goals, the recommendations vary, but it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and see how it makes you feel to adjust accordingly.

U: It’s too much too fast
B: Okay, we can make a deal. You can skip the exercise for the week, but you have to promise to walk at least 10000 steps a day and try your best to do some bodyweight exercise at home. Do some bodyweight squats, pushups from your knees, try to hold a plank for a bit. These things will help condition your body for proper exercise.

B: By making sure you’re in a caloric deficit. If you feel like you aren’t losing weight, or not losing it fast enough, start by eating a little less and see how it affects you.
U: How much less shall I eat?
B: I suggest you start by cutting 100-200 kcal. See what happens and adjust accordingly.

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
dL are referred to as 'normal'. Normal physiology allows the brain and the testes to work together to keep testosterone in this range.
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

At the end of the week, make sure to mention this on your progress report and I’ll make sure to not go easy on you next week.
U: Can we make the adjustments now?

U: What kind of changes?

U: Shall I go vegetarian?
B: It depends. Why do you consider going plant-based? (Ethical reasons) (Health concerns) (Weight loss)
U: Ethical reasons
B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

B: What do you expect me to do? I got some motivational quotes here, will that help? I doubt it. Motivation is a myth, what you need here is discipline.
U: How do I get more disciplined?
B: That’s simple, but not easy. You just need to take it one day at a time and be strict with yourself. Set a goal and work towards it, without cutting yourself any extra slack.
U: But I need rest too.
B: Of course! No diet or workout plan make sense if you can’t stick to them. Planing for some downtime is crucial. Rest should be a part of your workout routine too.

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
dL and 1000 ng
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

U: 'Just started Wellbutrin 1 week ago. Was taking Lexparo 20 mg for about 6 years. About 6 months ago the depression grew in a negative way. I cut back to 10 mg a day.... BAD IDEA for me. Hopelessness, despair, tiredness were just a few of the negative kickbacks. Asked doctor to try Wellbutrin. After one week my appetite is finally, after 47 years, under control. I read that this medicine was good long term, only problem is the loud ringing in ears and this weird feeling in my head. I'm hoping the weird head feeling will go away, but other than that so far so good. Despaired feeling is gone, but I am a little emotional. '

U: Best time to exercise
B: There isn't a single best time, it really is all up to you. The only advice I can give is to refrain from heavy exercise later in the evening. If you aren't a morning person, a good workout just before dinner will leave you with enough time to wind down before bed. Just don't work out for about two hours after a meal and you're all good!

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
dL and 1000 ng
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

B: Protein is probably the most important nutrient on your self-improvement journey. Sufficient protein intake will help you build muscle, lose unwanted fat, and keep your energy levels nice and stable. It was shown that even in untrained individuals increased protein intake leads to more lean muscle mass. Imagine what it can do for you if you also stick to your workout routine!
U: please continue
B: In terms of protein goals, the recommendations vary, but it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and see how it makes you feel to adjust accordingly.

U: move on

U: Can I lose some weight quickly?
B: It’s generally not recommended as rapid weight loss might be detrimental to your health. However, as you go on a healthy diet with a restricted calorie intake, you’re likely to lose quite a lot of water weight in the first week or two. You might also consider fasting if there are no preexisting health concerns.

U: It hurts when I do deadlifts.
B: Ouch. That’s not supposed to happen! If that’s just muscle ache or fatigue you’re experiencing — make sure to give your body more time to rest between workouts. if you’ve pulled a muscle, having joint pain, or something more serious — stop immediately and see if it improves. If the pain persists, go see a doctor!

U: Best time to exercise
B: There isn't a single best time, it really is all up to you. The only advice I can give is to refrain from heavy exercise later in the evening. If you aren't a morning person, a good workout just before dinner will leave you with enough time to wind down before bed. Just don't work out for about two hours after a meal and you're all good!

There are some vitamin deficiencies that can happen when you’re in a caloric deficit, so make sure you’re taking your daily multivitamin and drink enough water, when on a restricted diet.

U: go on
B: As a rule of thumb, it will take you a few weeks to start feeling better, a few months to start looking better, and about half a year for others to start noticing the changes.
U: What kind of changes?
B: If you have some extra weight, your face will get slimmer and more chiseled. As you build muscle, your pecs and traps will start showing from under your t-shirt, then your forearm and biceps, and you’ll start turning into that sexy V-shape ladies just love.

B: Unfortunately, you can’t lose weight in a specific area of your body. So you’re gonna have to lower your overall body fat percentage.

U: don't know what to say
B: I understand the struggle, but we’re taking it slow here and you should just try and push through it. The first couple of weeks will be tough, but it’s worth it, I promise!
U: It’s too much too fast
B: Okay, we can make a deal. You can skip the exercise for the week, but you have to promise to walk at least 10000 steps a day and try your best to do some bodyweight exercise at home. Do some bodyweight squats, pushups from your knees, try to hold a plank for a bit. These things will help condition your body for proper exercise.

See how it makes you feel, how well it fits in your routine, and take it from there. Take a look at the 'Nutrition' track under 'Program' for more info.

There are some vitamin deficiencies that can happen when you’re in a caloric deficit, so make sure you’re taking your daily multivitamin and drink enough water, when on a restricted diet.

U: So what can I do?
B: Let’s keep it up for a few more weeks. Please, don’t forget to mention your sleep quality in our weekly feedback sessions. If no improvement happens, it might be a good idea to see a doctor.

U: Shall I exclude meat from my diet?
B: It depends. Why do you consider going plant-based? (Ethical reasons) (Health concerns) (Weight loss)
U: Ethical reasons
B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

U: What kind of changes?

My first time was horrendous haha the cramps oh my goodness but then the relief oh my was I cleaned out felt amazing.

U: hmm...

U: yep
B: Alright, just kidding, this goes without saying.

U: hmm...
B: Tell me, what’s going on?
I crave junk food
B: Hey man, you really gotta stop letting food be the boss of you. At the end of the day, it’s just fuel for your body. As long as it gets all the nutrients, you should try to stop caring about what you eat so much, After all, it all comes out the same way, so why bother?
U: I’m sore
B: No, man, don’t even start. Skipping is not an option. Unless you’re seriously injured, a half-assed workout beats no workout. I promise, as soon as you get the blood flowing, you’ll be grateful you made it to the gym.
U: The program is too tough
B: I know it can be hard sometimes. We all have our good and bad days, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop trying. Do one small thing and you’ll probably feel like you can do more. And if not, remember: failure isn’t the opposite of success. It’s a part of it.
U: Today’s program is too much
B: We all have bad days, man. You’ll be surprised how much can depend on what you ate for dinner yesterday, how well did you sleep last night, and what your body is currently going through. Try your best to make little steps towards your goal and we’ll reassess your routine next week, alright?

U: Shall I go vegetarian?
B: It depends. Why do you consider going plant-based? (Ethical reasons) (Health concerns) (Weight loss)
U: Ethical reasons
B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

B: What do you expect me to do? I got some motivational quotes here, will that help? I doubt it. Motivation is a myth, what you need here is discipline.
U: How do I get more disciplined?
B: That’s simple, but not easy. You just need to take it one day at a time and be strict with yourself. Set a goal and work towards it, without cutting yourself any extra slack.
U: But I need rest too.
B: Of course! No diet or workout plan make sense if you can’t stick to them. Planing for some downtime is crucial. Rest should be a part of your workout routine too.

B: Take a look at the meal ideas and recipes in the Nutrition track. Try to balance plant-based foods and animal products, as well as carbs, fats, and protein. The more color you have on your plate, the better! Variety is the key.
U: Recommendations
B: Check out the Nutrition track for a list of recommended products and foods you should avoid. When shopping, don’t just cover the basics but make sure you always have some healthy foods you actually enjoy at home. This way you’ll be less likely to cheat and order take out or run out to get some ice cream,

B: Aren’t we all, man... aren’t we all.
U: ...
B: Tell me, what’s going on?
I want food
B: Hey man, you really gotta stop letting food be the boss of you. At the end of the day, it’s just fuel for your body. As long as it gets all the nutrients, you should try to stop caring about what you eat so much, After all, it all comes out the same way, so why bother?
U: I’m sore
B: No, man, don’t even start. Skipping is not an option. Unless you’re seriously injured, a half-assed workout beats no workout. I promise, as soon as you get the blood flowing, you’ll be grateful you made it to the gym.
U: The program is too tough
B: I know it can be hard sometimes. We all have our good and bad days, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop trying. Do one small thing and you’ll probably feel like you can do more. And if not, remember: failure isn’t the opposite of success. It’s a part of it.
U: Today’s program is too much
B: We all have bad days, man. You’ll be surprised how much can depend on what you ate for dinner yesterday, how well did you sleep last night, and what your body is currently going through. Try your best to make little steps towards your goal and we’ll reassess your routine next week, alright?

U: How much protein I need in a day
B: It really depends on your goals and how active you are throughout the day. Generally, it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and adjust. See how it makes you feel, how well it fits in your routine, and take it from there. Take a look at the 'Nutrition' track under 'Program' for more info.

U: Shall I exclude meat from my diet?
B: It depends. Why do you consider going plant-based? (Ethical reasons) (Health concerns) (Weight loss)
U: Ethical reasons
B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

B: In general, no they aren’t. That is, as long as you don’t starve yourself and eat at least two full well-balanced meals per day. There are some vitamin deficiencies that can happen when you’re in a caloric deficit, so make sure you’re taking your daily multivitamin and drink enough water, when on a restricted diet.

B: What do you expect me to do? I got some motivational quotes here, will that help? I doubt it. Motivation is a myth, what you need here is discipline.
U: How do I get more disciplined?
B: That’s simple, but not easy. You just need to take it one day at a time and be strict with yourself. Set a goal and work towards it, without cutting yourself any extra slack.
U: But I need rest too.
B: Of course! No diet or workout plan make sense if you can’t stick to them. Planing for some downtime is crucial. Rest should be a part of your workout routine too.

U: Can I lose some weight quickly?
B: It’s generally not recommended as rapid weight loss might be detrimental to your health. However, as you go on a healthy diet with a restricted calorie intake, you’re likely to lose quite a lot of water weight in the first week or two. You might also consider fasting if there are no preexisting health concerns.

I’m was diagnosed with GERD. What do I do?
B: Well, listen to your doctor, for one. That said, doing some research at home and seeking a second opinion can never hurt. As far as what we’re doing here goes: discuss it with your doctor. Sport, diet, and sleep cannot make you feel worse, but humans are delicate and intricate creatures and after all, I’m just a bot.
U: Can I continue the same exercise routine?

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
B: In healthy men, testosterone levels between 350 ng
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

Should’ve done this earlier
B: Glad to hear that. Let me share a little lifehack. Put these thoughts on a post-it or in the notes on your phone and next time you’re struggling with motivation — let your past self motivate you.

U: I feel like the exercise routine isn’t too hard.
B: Well, that’s good news! I planned to start you slowly and see how quickly you progress. Feel free to throw in a few more reps, or do some extra pushups after you’re done with today’s program. At the end of the week, make sure to mention this on your progress report and I’ll make sure to not go easy on you next week.
U: Can we make the adjustments now?
B: Sorry, that’s not possible. Once the weekly plan is created, it cannot be changed. This is why I need your weekly feedback — the more you tell me about your progress, the better can I tailor your programs.

B: hi man! How are you today?
U: 'I've battled migraines since I was 14 and was diagnosed with PMDD. 10 to 15 days out of the month I get crippling migranes. I've tried numerous things and nothing has really helped. I've been on Inderal for a couple days now along with Norco and still have what I would consider a fairly bad headache. I'm still seeing the aura and occasional star flashes in my eyes. I'm hoping something changes here soon. I will say last night was my first night since I've had my son, I slept a full 6 hours straight. '

U: 'I have had grand mal seizures since I was 9 years old and was involved in a car accident. I have taken Dilantin for over 50 years, with good results. It has controlled my seizures pretty well until recently. I was diagnosed with COPD 2 years ago, and in that time, I have been having seizures every 3-6 months. My doctor switched me to Keppra 6 months ago, and in that time, I have had at least 1 seizure a month. I think it's time to switch back to what works.'

B: It's a fancy term for a drink made from the juices of green vegetables. There is no official recipe, so you can totally get creative with yours. The most common ingredients are kale, celery, spinach, cucumber, avocado, mint, and other herbs. It doesn't have to be just vegetables too.

U: What home workout tips do you have?
B: To be honest, exercising at home isn't much different from gym workouts. You should try to have a dedicated at-home workout space. Make sure there are no distractions and you can give your 100%. To help with motivation, prepare everything ahead of time: your weights, your clothes, and shoes, your music - everything has to be ready and waiting for you. Also, if you're a beginner, take it easy at first. After all, it's just you, no instructors or more experienced gym-goers around, so it's better to play it safe until you get a hang of it.

U: Best time to exercise
B: There isn't a single best time, it really is all up to you. The only advice I can give is to refrain from heavy exercise later in the evening. If you aren't a morning person, a good workout just before dinner will leave you with enough time to wind down before bed. Just don't work out for about two hours after a meal and you're all good!

U: The progress will reverse?
B: Yes, self-improvement is a constant battle. You gotta keep up!
U: Can I tone it down a notch?
B: Yes, sure. Again, as soon as you’re happy with the results, you can go into the maintenance mode, and do less. Keep in mind though, that if you start exercising less, you’ll need to adjust your diet, otherwise you’ll start gaining weight.

U: How much protein I need in a day
B: It really depends on your goals and how active you are throughout the day. Generally, it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and adjust. See how it makes you feel, how well it fits in your routine, and take it from there. Take a look at the 'Nutrition' track under 'Program' for more info.

U: Shall I exclude meat from my diet?
B: It depends. Why do you consider going plant-based? (Ethical reasons) (Health concerns) (Weight loss)
U: Ethical reasons
B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

U: How quickly can I lose weight?
B: Over the long term, you should aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds a week. To lose this much weight, you need to burn 500 to 1000 calories more than you consume each day. Anything over that is considered unhealthy and can cause issues down the line.

B: Oh man, that sucks... No biggie though. It’s probably nothing a cold compress, a warming cream, or a good massage can’t fix. Consider it a paid time off - no workouts for you for the next few days. Still, though, do your best to stay active during that time

U: I need some extra motivation?
B: What do you expect me to do? I got some motivational quotes here, will that help? I doubt it. Motivation is a myth, what you need here is discipline.
U: How do I get more disciplined?
B: That’s simple, but not easy. You just need to take it one day at a time and be strict with yourself. Set a goal and work towards it, without cutting yourself any extra slack.
U: But I need rest too.
B: Of course! No diet or workout plan make sense if you can’t stick to them. Planing for some downtime is crucial. Rest should be a part of your workout routine too.

U: What home workout tips do you have?
B: To be honest, exercising at home isn't much different from gym workouts. You should try to have a dedicated at-home workout space. Make sure there are no distractions and you can give your 100%. To help with motivation, prepare everything ahead of time: your weights, your clothes, and shoes, your music - everything has to be ready and waiting for you. Also, if you're a beginner, take it easy at first. After all, it's just you, no instructors or more experienced gym-goers around, so it's better to play it safe until you get a hang of it.

U: Aren’t diets unhealthy?
B: In general, no they aren’t. That is, as long as you don’t starve yourself and eat at least two full well-balanced meals per day. There are some vitamin deficiencies that can happen when you’re in a caloric deficit, so make sure you’re taking your daily multivitamin and drink enough water, when on a restricted diet.

U: Best time to exercise
B: There isn't a single best time, it really is all up to you. The only advice I can give is to refrain from heavy exercise later in the evening. If you aren't a morning person, a good workout just before dinner will leave you with enough time to wind down before bed. Just don't work out for about two hours after a meal and you're all good!

U: Shall I exclude meat from my diet?
B: It depends. Why do you consider going plant-based? (Ethical reasons) (Health concerns) (Weight loss)
U: Ethical reasons
B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

U: There are no healthy options at this restaurant , what do I eat?
B: Well, you don’t need superfoods and organic vegetables to stay in shape and be healthy. An occasional treat can’t hurt you. Make sure your body has enough fuel to keep going, and if you end up indulging in some guilty pleasures, make up for it with your next meals.

If you’re feeling bad about it - go walk some extra steps today, do some pushups or bodyweight squats just to get the blood flowing. And maybe try pushing yourself a little bit harder during the next workout, since your body had plenty of time to recover.
