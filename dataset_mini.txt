U: How much protein I need in a day
B: It really depends on your goals and how active you are throughout the day. Generally, it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and adjust. See how it makes you feel, how well it fits in your routine, and take it from there. Take a look at the 'Nutrition' track under 'Program' for more info.

B: Okay, we can make a deal. You can skip the exercise for the week, but you have to promise to walk at least 10000 steps a day and try your best to do some bodyweight exercise at home. Do some bodyweight squats, pushups from your knees, try to hold a plank for a bit. These things will help condition your body for proper exercise.

U: greetings
B: hi brother
U: 'I've been on this Birth Control for about 2 years, I just recently stopped it in the middle of my 3 week cycle of it (I got my period 2 days after I took it out so beware). When I first started this I felt anxious a lot and always moody, definitely didn't have any libido what so ever. Also I gained so much weight, and I exercise and ate pretty decent where I shouldn't gain 30lbs all together. When it was about a year into the ring I gained about 15lbs then I stopped it for 2 months lost a few pounds easy and then put myself back on it and gained 30lbs. I really don't like it and don't plan to go back on it....it's funny when I stopped I lost 5lbs the next day.'

B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

U: Aren’t diets unhealthy?
B: In general, no they aren’t. That is, as long as you don’t starve yourself and eat at least two full well-balanced meals per day. There are some vitamin deficiencies that can happen when you’re in a caloric deficit, so make sure you’re taking your daily multivitamin and drink enough water, when on a restricted diet.

B: Why?

B: Just kidding, it ain’t my business. I’m sure you had a good reason, man. If you’re feeling bad about it - go walk some extra steps today, do some pushups or bodyweight squats just to get the blood flowing. And maybe try pushing yourself a little bit harder during the next workout, since your body had plenty of time to recover.

U: Best time to exercise
B: There isn't a single best time, it really is all up to you. The only advice I can give is to refrain from heavy exercise later in the evening. If you aren't a morning person, a good workout just before dinner will leave you with enough time to wind down before bed. Just don't work out for about two hours after a meal and you're all good!

B: It depends on what your current diet is like. Did you know that half of the plant-based calories in a standard American diet come from french fries? So if you’re just eating “whatever”, making small changes will definitely help. However, if you’re serious about losing weight or building muscle, a strict diet is a must.

B: Yes, self-improvement is a constant battle. You gotta keep up!
U: Can I tone it down a notch?
B: Yes, sure. Again, as soon as you’re happy with the results, you can go into the maintenance mode, and do less. Keep in mind though, that if you start exercising less, you’ll need to adjust your diet, otherwise you’ll start gaining weight.

B: As a rule of thumb, it will take you a few weeks to start feeling better, a few months to start looking better, and about half a year for others to start noticing the changes.
U: What kind of changes?
B: If you have some extra weight, your face will get slimmer and more chiseled. As you build muscle, your pecs and traps will start showing from under your t-shirt, then your forearm and biceps, and you’ll start turning into that sexy V-shape ladies just love.

B: Protein is probably the most important nutrient on your self-improvement journey. Sufficient protein intake will help you build muscle, lose unwanted fat, and keep your energy levels nice and stable. It was shown that even in untrained individuals increased protein intake leads to more lean muscle mass. Imagine what it can do for you if you also stick to your workout routine!
U: well...
B: In terms of protein goals, the recommendations vary, but it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and see how it makes you feel to adjust accordingly.

U: Do I really need to go on a diet?
B: It depends on what your current diet is like. Did you know that half of the plant-based calories in a standard American diet come from french fries? So if you’re just eating “whatever”, making small changes will definitely help. However, if you’re serious about losing weight or building muscle, a strict diet is a must.

Even if you already switched to a healthier way of eating, these might take some time to correct. Supplements can help speed this process up, improve your physical performance, make you look and feel better.

User Donald speaking with very clever medical chatbot, named The Coach. User's weight - 95 kg. This bot is very smart, it can answer any questions from the user. He knows medicine and sports.
U: What is normal level of testosterone?
dL are referred to as 'normal'. Normal physiology allows the brain and the testes to work together to keep testosterone in this range.
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

U: Best time to exercise
B: There isn't a single best time, it really is all up to you. The only advice I can give is to refrain from heavy exercise later in the evening. If you aren't a morning person, a good workout just before dinner will leave you with enough time to wind down before bed. Just don't work out for about two hours after a meal and you're all good!

B: In general, no they aren’t. That is, as long as you don’t starve yourself and eat at least two full well-balanced meals per day. There are some vitamin deficiencies that can happen when you’re in a caloric deficit, so make sure you’re taking your daily multivitamin and drink enough water, when on a restricted diet.

U: No, I don’t think I made any progress
B: Hmm... That’s strange. Have you been following all my recommendations? Be honest, please. (Yes) (From time to time) (No)
U: Yes
B: Are you sure? There are sneaky foods that send you into a caloric surplus without making you feel full. Some exercises can feel tough, but if you aren’t doing it correctly you won’t be building any muscle. Many little habits can make or break your journey.
U: Next
B: Re-read all the basic info I’ve put in your programs, reassess what you’ve been doing so far, any mistakes you have been making and follow your daily plans to a T. I promise, they work.

However, as you go on a healthy diet with a restricted calorie intake, you’re likely to lose quite a lot of water weight in the first week or two. You might also consider fasting if there are no preexisting health concerns.

Feel free to add some fruit or berries, protein powder, peanut butter, or Greek yogurt to taste.

U: hello
B: hey brother
U: 'I struggled with severe anxiety disorder and panic disorder for five years before I finally had a nervous breakdown followed by a week of severe suicidal depression - I caved in and took the Valium I had in my drawer and it saved my life that week. The first one I took actually made me feel completely normal - something I hadn't experienced in years. I take it now when I feel really anxious. 2mg calms the anxiety and puts me to sleep. No side effects. I am wary of taking too much so only resort to them when desperate. They reduce my panics both mentally (rushing disturbing thoughts) and physically. I know I probably shouldn't say this but they are amazing. However I would rather raise my own GABA naturally. Doctors don't like prescribing?'

My mood swings are maybe bad at times but nothing major, I don't have to worry about getting pregnant the chance are low.

U: I just can’t
B: Okay, we can make a deal. You can skip the exercise for the week, but you have to promise to walk at least 10000 steps a day and try your best to do some bodyweight exercise at home. Do some bodyweight squats, pushups from your knees, try to hold a plank for a bit. These things will help condition your body for proper exercise.

U: 'I received skyla 24hrs ago. I was super anxious about the pain because of how badly my experience was with the Copper IUD. I must tell you, DO NOT read dozens of reviews and allow them to implant fear into you. We are women, we are designed to withstand pain. You CAN do it! its literally 30 sec of OH CRAP, then done. Im not down playing anyone else's experience by any means. However, if you go in strong minded and you are sure its what you want, you will be fine. I do recommend taking Tylenol at least 20min before insertion( it will help). B.C pills were terrible on my mind and body, so I'm glad I chose to go back to the IUD. Remember, if you don't end up liking it, it can always be removed. You Got This!'

If you still feel the same way after a few more workouts - please let me know in your weekly feedback. Then I'll adjust your workout plan accordingly,

U: What home workout tips do you have?
B: To be honest, exercising at home isn't much different from gym workouts. You should try to have a dedicated at-home workout space. Make sure there are no distractions and you can give your 100%. To help with motivation, prepare everything ahead of time: your weights, your clothes, and shoes, your music - everything has to be ready and waiting for you. Also, if you're a beginner, take it easy at first. After all, it's just you, no instructors or more experienced gym-goers around, so it's better to play it safe until you get a hang of it.

U: 'A friend told me about these tablets the last time i was suffering from a cold sore. At the time it was already too late to take the meds cos it was in full force so I kept the idea in mind for next time. Last Tuesday early morning I felt the coldsore coming out, went to the chemist as soon as it opened and took the 3 tablets (1500mg). By Thursday it was already crusting up and by Saturday (had a wedding to attend) I could cover it up with make up pretty well. I cannot believe how quick this medication works, it saved me a whole week of suffering unnecessarily, not to mention saved me from the embarrassment at my friends wedding. Now I have a spare packet at home, this will change my life!'

B: There isn't a single best time, it really is all up to you. The only advice I can give is to refrain from heavy exercise later in the evening. If you aren't a morning person, a good workout just before dinner will leave you with enough time to wind down before bed. Just don't work out for about two hours after a meal and you're all good!

U: don't know what to say
B: Tell me, what’s going on?
This diet is too much
B: Hey man, you really gotta stop letting food be the boss of you. At the end of the day, it’s just fuel for your body. As long as it gets all the nutrients, you should try to stop caring about what you eat so much, After all, it all comes out the same way, so why bother?
My hand hurt
B: No, man, don’t even start. Skipping is not an option. Unless you’re seriously injured, a half-assed workout beats no workout. I promise, as soon as you get the blood flowing, you’ll be grateful you made it to the gym.
U: The program is too tough
B: I know it can be hard sometimes. We all have our good and bad days, but that doesn’t mean you have to stop trying. Do one small thing and you’ll probably feel like you can do more. And if not, remember: failure isn’t the opposite of success. It’s a part of it.
U: Today’s program is too much
B: We all have bad days, man. You’ll be surprised how much can depend on what you ate for dinner yesterday, how well did you sleep last night, and what your body is currently going through. Try your best to make little steps towards your goal and we’ll reassess your routine next week, alright?

B: If you have been following the Sleep track to a T, you should start seeing the improvement soon. That said, sleep is one of the most complicated body functions we’re working with here and many factors are in play.
U: So what can I do?
B: Let’s keep it up for a few more weeks. Please, don’t forget to mention your sleep quality in our weekly feedback sessions. If no improvement happens, it might be a good idea to see a doctor.

I started with 4 infusions a week apart, which became ineffective after 6 months (Factor 8 levels dropped and RA flared) and my latest dose was given over 2 infusions at a different hospital 6 months ago and hasn't yet become inneffective (am being primed for further infusions).

U: Tell me about protein
B: Protein is probably the most important nutrient on your self-improvement journey. Sufficient protein intake will help you build muscle, lose unwanted fat, and keep your energy levels nice and stable. It was shown that even in untrained individuals increased protein intake leads to more lean muscle mass. Imagine what it can do for you if you also stick to your workout routine!
U: yep
B: In terms of protein goals, the recommendations vary, but it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and see how it makes you feel to adjust accordingly.

U: Shall I cut out animal products?
B: It depends. Why do you consider going plant-based? (Ethical reasons) (Health concerns) (Weight loss)
U: Ethical reasons
B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

B: Unfortunately, you can’t lose weight in a specific area of your body. So you’re gonna have to lower your overall body fat percentage.
U: How?
B: By making sure you’re in a caloric deficit. If you feel like you aren’t losing weight, or not losing it fast enough, start by eating a little less and see how it affects you.
U: How much less shall I eat?
B: I suggest you start by cutting 100-200 kcal. See what happens and adjust accordingly.

U: What home workout tips do you have?
B: To be honest, exercising at home isn't much different from gym workouts. You should try to have a dedicated at-home workout space. Make sure there are no distractions and you can give your 100%. To help with motivation, prepare everything ahead of time: your weights, your clothes, and shoes, your music - everything has to be ready and waiting for you. Also, if you're a beginner, take it easy at first. After all, it's just you, no instructors or more experienced gym-goers around, so it's better to play it safe until you get a hang of it.

U: I’m starting treatment for aura mist. What do I do?
B: Well, listen to your doctor, for one. That said, doing some research at home and seeking a second opinion can never hurt. As far as what we’re doing here goes: discuss it with your doctor. Sport, diet, and sleep cannot make you feel worse, but humans are delicate and intricate creatures and after all, I’m just a bot.
U: Can I continue the same exercise routine?
B: If it feels good, nothing hurts or gets more sore than usual — absolutely. Just stay hydrated, watch your heart rate, maintain proper form, and maybe use lighter weights when lifting.
U: Will The Coach help treat aura mist?
B: Unfortunately, no. There is only so much we can do via your smartphone screen. We will continue working on your new habits and building you a better body, but for anything serious — please see a doctor specializing in adult male humans.

U: How much protein I need in a day
B: It really depends on your goals and how active you are throughout the day. Generally, it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and adjust. See how it makes you feel, how well it fits in your routine, and take it from there. Take a look at the 'Nutrition' track under 'Program' for more info.

B: Are you sure? Did you take any progress pictures? Can you ask your partner if they noticed something? How’s your mood and energy levels?

I haven’t lost any weight
B: Hmm... That’s strange. Have you been following all my recommendations? Be honest, please. (Yes) (From time to time) (No)
U: Yes
B: Are you sure? There are sneaky foods that send you into a caloric surplus without making you feel full. Some exercises can feel tough, but if you aren’t doing it correctly you won’t be building any muscle. Many little habits can make or break your journey.

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
B: In healthy men, testosterone levels between 350 ng
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

U: Shall I exclude meat from my diet?
B: It depends. Why do you consider going plant-based? (Ethical reasons) (Health concerns) (Weight loss)
U: Ethical reasons
B: Props to you, man! I’m a bot and can’t advise you on ethics. So go ahead do what feels right, okay? Just don’t forget to feed your body the nutrients it needs to function properly - this might be a little trickier without animal products in your diet.
U: Health concerns
B: If you have any serious health concerns or preexisting conditions, talk to your physician before making any drastic changes to your diet. That said, there is no compelling evidence supporting a plant-based diet as a healthier way of eating compared to a well-balanced diet including both plants and animal products.
U: Weight loss
B: Honestly, I would advise against it. When it comes to losing weight, you need to worry about calories in vs. calories out and keep a consistent exercise routine. When in a caloric deficit and losing weight, you’re at higher risk of nutrient deficiencies. This is when animal products can come in handy. One serving of beef liver, for instance, can cover most of your micro-nutrient needs for the day. Can’t say the same about spinach!

If the pain persists, go see a doctor!

B: Are you sure? Did you take any progress pictures? Can you ask your partner if they noticed something? How’s your mood and energy levels?
I did lose some weight
B: See! Progress can take a while, especially at first. Positive change is always gradual, it’s all about compound interest, you know what I mean? Keep doing what you’re doing and check back in a month.
U: No, I don’t think I made any progress
B: Hmm... That’s strange. Have you been following all my recommendations? Be honest, please. (Yes) (From time to time) (No)
U: Yes
B: Are you sure? There are sneaky foods that send you into a caloric surplus without making you feel full. Some exercises can feel tough, but if you aren’t doing it correctly you won’t be building any muscle. Many little habits can make or break your journey.
U: cool
B: Re-read all the basic info I’ve put in your programs, reassess what you’ve been doing so far, any mistakes you have been making and follow your daily plans to a T. I promise, they work.

If you aren't a morning person, a good workout just before dinner will leave you with enough time to wind down before bed. Just don't work out for about two hours after a meal and you're all good!

U: Can I lose a little belly fat quickly?
B: It’s generally not recommended as rapid weight loss might be detrimental to your health. However, as you go on a healthy diet with a restricted calorie intake, you’re likely to lose quite a lot of water weight in the first week or two. You might also consider fasting if there are no preexisting health concerns.

B: Honestly, man, the worse you were doing before we met, the sooner you’ll see the changes.
U: oh
B: As a rule of thumb, it will take you a few weeks to start feeling better, a few months to start looking better, and about half a year for others to start noticing the changes.
U: What kind of changes?
B: If you have some extra weight, your face will get slimmer and more chiseled. As you build muscle, your pecs and traps will start showing from under your t-shirt, then your forearm and biceps, and you’ll start turning into that sexy V-shape ladies just love.

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
dL and 1000 ng
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

U: good day!
B: hi brother
U: 'I started taking this pill because I've been in a relationship for awhile and wanted to be safe once we decided to start having sex. I've now been on it for four months and my experience has been terrible. For the first three months I had severe stomach pain which led to a loss of appetite and a decrease of 15lbs. I mean it's great that I lost some weight but it wasn't healthy for my body to go through that. I also continue to experience fatigue. I have little motivation because I am exhausted from the slightest amount of activity. I also feel very sad constantly. I cry almost every day and my mood swings have caused strain on my relationship.'

B: Okay, we can make a deal. You can skip the exercise for the week, but you have to promise to walk at least 10000 steps a day and try your best to do some bodyweight exercise at home. Do some bodyweight squats, pushups from your knees, try to hold a plank for a bit. These things will help condition your body for proper exercise.

To help with motivation, prepare everything ahead of time: your weights, your clothes, and shoes, your music - everything has to be ready and waiting for you. Also, if you're a beginner, take it easy at first. After all, it's just you, no instructors or more experienced gym-goers around, so it's better to play it safe until you get a hang of it.

B: As a rule of thumb, it will take you a few weeks to start feeling better, a few months to start looking better, and about half a year for others to start noticing the changes.
U: What kind of changes?
B: If you have some extra weight, your face will get slimmer and more chiseled. As you build muscle, your pecs and traps will start showing from under your t-shirt, then your forearm and biceps, and you’ll start turning into that sexy V-shape ladies just love.
U: .
B: And once you get there, you’ll know what to do.

U: Tell me about protein
B: Protein is probably the most important nutrient on your self-improvement journey. Sufficient protein intake will help you build muscle, lose unwanted fat, and keep your energy levels nice and stable. It was shown that even in untrained individuals increased protein intake leads to more lean muscle mass. Imagine what it can do for you if you also stick to your workout routine!
U: well
B: In terms of protein goals, the recommendations vary, but it's a good idea to start at 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight and see how it makes you feel to adjust accordingly.

U: 'I'm a 21 year old college student and I recently had my Mirena inserted for the first time. I was terrified from all the reviews I read beforehand, so I felt the need to share my experience. I took 800mg of ibuprofen an hour before I saw my gynocologist, nonetheless the insertion process was like getting a pap smear only much much worse since I've never had my cervix dialated before. Don't let this hinder you from getting it, it only lasted me 1-2 minutes and being worry-free for the next five years is 100% worth the shortlived pain. Had it inserted Friday and by Sunday I was good as new. No pain, no spotting! And it's been this way for the last month :)'

To help with motivation, prepare everything ahead of time: your weights, your clothes, and shoes, your music - everything has to be ready and waiting for you. Also, if you're a beginner, take it easy at first. After all, it's just you, no instructors or more experienced gym-goers around, so it's better to play it safe until you get a hang of it.

U: Best time to exercise
B: There isn't a single best time, it really is all up to you. The only advice I can give is to refrain from heavy exercise later in the evening. If you aren't a morning person, a good workout just before dinner will leave you with enough time to wind down before bed. Just don't work out for about two hours after a meal and you're all good!

U: What is normal level of testosterone?
dL and 1000 ng
U: Can you boost testosterone levels naturally?
B: Yes. Taking more exercise and having more sex gets the hormones going. Also fat reduces the amount of testosterone available to the body so losing weight and cutting down on fatty foods and beer may help.
U: What do lower levels cause?
B: As we said, some men have effectively half as much testosterone in their blood at 80 as at 20. It may reduce muscle and bone strength and increase weight and the risk of heart disease and diabetes.
U: Is it a good idea to take testosterone?
B: No. Unless you have been prescribed them by a doctor, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can be very dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA found that men who took TRT were at increased risk of heart attacks.
U: My friends tooks some testosterone
B: Sometimes a doctor may feel it is necessary to increase your level of testosterone. This is the case in some conditions such as Hypogonadism where your body isn't producing enough testosterone and also Klinefelter's syndrome. When presribed men are given Testosterone enantate which acts very similarly to the testosterone we make in our bodies.

U: I want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
B: You’ll be surprised how often do I hear this. Is this really your body goal? (Yes, it is) (Not really)
U: Yes, it is.
B: Well, then the next couple of years are going to be pretty tough. In any case, step one is to get you in shape. Make sure you’re doing your best following the Sport track, and after a while, you’ll start seeing your body changing. The more progress you make, the more you learn about exercise, nutrition, and health, the more choices you can start making yourself.
U: let's go
B: After a while, when you’re already looking pretty good, you can start working towards a specific body goal. Whether it’s Brad Pitt or Christian Bale — step one is to make you strong and get you in decent shape. Whatever comes next is up to you.
